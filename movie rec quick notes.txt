recommendation system in python usig scikit


//machine learning pipeline
data extraction and cleaning(extract and clean the data): python, ruby, shellscripts, selenium(internet)
Building ML model : scikit learn, 3rd party api : azure ml, tensorflow, google
bulid software infrastructure : javascript, ruby on rails, webto py, github, deploy to clud aws/azure

//supervised ML
data set -> given
predict using parameters form given dataset----------------> build prediction model

//recommendation
based on past or based on similar profiles(like friends, etc)
preferences--->similar products
based on relevancy

types of recommendation systems
users     items
matches these parameters


1. popularity based(trending) keep track of how many users are watching
2. content based(user interaccted w something---->find similar items to this---->recommend back to user)
3. collaborative filtering(peer to peer suggestions), similar users recommend their inetrest to each other

//similarity between the  content
similarity = come up with a score----> math calculations-----> plot distance between the vectors---> get coords from the items bw which we find similarity-----> find distance bw the two vectors ----->angualr dist or euclidean distance-------> start with cos theta 
use pyhton for calculations----->cosine similarity------> 

//angular distance vs euclidean distance


//dataset from IMDB


movie matrix of vectors-----> python converts  to tuples---------> sort based on similarity scores
